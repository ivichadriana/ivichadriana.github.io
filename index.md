## About Me

PhD candidate in Bioengineering specializing in machine learning and computational biology.

I am passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems in biology and medicine. With a background in **neuroscience** and **bioengineering**, I have developed extensive expertise in data analysis, model development, and software engineering. My current research involves developing generative models, like **conditional Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**, to transform and analyze complex biological datasets.
